This is a complex project that represents the work done by multiple individuals as part of their bachelor's and/or master's degree and/or as part of their research activity. The project realies upon taking numerous different neural spikes of the human brain and find a proper way to transform and cluster them in such a way that at the end of the process it will be possible to tell which neural spikes came from which neuron.

I contributed to this project as part of my master's degree thesis. My contribution can be found in the "main_mihm" file, where I have written multiple functions and ran numerous experiments in order to attempt to find an usefull, efficient and innovatiove way to cluster the neural spikes based on the neurons that produced them. In doing so I tried different clustering algorithms, fine tuned their parameters and tried different approaches in hopes of achieving the desired results.
